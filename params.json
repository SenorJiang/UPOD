The exception to this is moderators and SQA team leaders.\r\n*  Use the local resources. Don't use resources on other sites. If you need an external resource, ask me and i'll add a local copy to the repo.\r\n*  Use the file structure in place. New folders are created by administrators, ask them if you need to make one.\r\n*  Use descriptive commits. Explain what it is you did. \"$ git commit -m \"message\" is a useful command.\r\n*  If someone who opens an issue is unsure of how to resolve it, they may not be able to close it. This is perfectly fine and DBrown will like seeing our teamwork. I have added a `#help-wanted` label to our repo so if that is the case, then someone can step in and help them resolve it.\r\n* Speaking of labels, I have added several labels to Github: `#front-end`, `#back-end`,` #requirements`, `#help-wanted` and `#bug`. Please use these labels as the issues will soon be overfilled with an amalgamation of issues from various different parts of the application. Labelling your issues now will allow the team members to filter by their role. It will help everyone use Github more effectively!\r\n\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nIf you need any help with git hub please contact Robert Morouney <robert@morouney.com> and he will provide you with tutorials or help.  If you need help with anything else please contact your team leader. \r\n",
