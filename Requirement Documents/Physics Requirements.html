					<h2><a name="Scope">1.1 Scope</a></h2>

					<p>UPOD (Undergraduate Physics Online Database) is a website designed to the students with information about physics. The goal is to provide accurate and up to date physics knowledge for undergraduate students. There are currently very few quality physics reference sites, so UPOD has the opportunity to fill a large gap facing physics students at present.</p>

					<h3><a name="Definitions">1.2 Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations</a></h2>
					<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Fundamentals</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Fundamental physics is the study of basic materials, properties and forces in our world. It covers all sections of physics from mechanics to atomic physics, and gives a general understanding as to what physic properties governs our world.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Classical Mechanics</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Classical Mechanics is the study of physical laws that describe the motion of bodies under the influence of a system of forces.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Optics</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Optics is the specific branch of physics that involves the properties and behaviour of light in conjunction with matter and the various instruments that either use or detect it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Electricity and Magnetism</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Electricity and Magnetism is the study of physics that involves the electromagnetic force, which is an interaction that occurs between two electrically charged particles. Magnetism is the physical interaction that occurs as a result of a motion of electric charge that is usually a result of attractive and repulsive forces between objects.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Quantum Mechanics</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Quantum Mechanics is the specific branch of physics that deals with the very miniscule objects. It deals with the mathematical description of the motion and interaction of subatomic particles, which incorporates wave-particle duality, uncertainty principle, and concepts of quantization.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Statistical Mechanics</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Statistical Mechanics is the study of the statistics of the behaviour of very large number of atoms or molecules. It takes into account the distribution of energy among the large number of molecules.</p>
