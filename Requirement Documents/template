For the Back End, Graphics, Physics requirements that were made, follow this template
 (note: This is for each LINK in the REFERENCES sectin of the main SRS):

1. Introduction
	1.1 Scope
		- see 5.1.2 Scope in IEEEE_830.pdf
		- e.g, explain what the Group is going to do for the project (Back End, Graphics, Physics)
		
	1.2 Definitions, acronyms, and abbreviations
		- this is where you describe any terms such Trees, Stacks, etc. to the client so they undersand the terms used.
		- 
	1.3 References
		- state all references EVER used into this section.
		- remember, if ever using statements such as 'See High Level Requirements.. ' then make sure to add that link in this section!
		
	1.4 Overview
		- look at Pong Tracker overview
		- talk about the things this document is about and how it is organized
		
2. Overall Description
	2.1 Product Perspective
		- STATE whether the product (your SRS) is independent or self-contained.
			i.e, Back End is independent of Front End, Front End is dependent on Back End
		- since these SRS' are components of a larger system (UPOD SRS as a whole) it 'should relate the requirements of that larger 
		  system to functionality of the software and should identify interfaces between that system and the software' (IEEE_830.pdf, 5.2.1)
		- try to include UML diagrams to show relevance!!

		- include System, User interface, etc. if necessary (it will be necessary!!!)
		- refer to IEEE830.pdf 5.2.1 a-h subsections.
		
		2.1.1 System Interfaces
			- if applicable - if front end, talk about how this will interface with the back end structure
		
		2.1.2 User Interfaces
			- if applicable, such as will the USERS be interacting with the interface
		
		2.1.4 Software Interfaces
			- refer to IEEE_830.pdf 5.2.1.4, pretty straight-forward
			- for instance Apache for front end and SQL for back end ??
		
		2.1.5 Communications Interfaces
			- if applicable (hopper)
		
		2.1.6 Memory
			- if applicable
			- for exampleif it is a memory constraint, SHOULD only apply to back end
		
	2.4 Constraints
		-  look at IEEE_830.pdf 5.2.4 to see what constraints necessary

		3.7.4 Feature
		3.7.5 Stimulus
		3.7.6 Response
		3.7.7 Functional Hierarchy
